omniorb for Debian
------------------

The Python bindings in omniidl are installed in a non-standard
path (which is not MultiArch-aware) and upstream choose to use
sys.path mangling to import the modules into the scripts in
/usr/bin/.

Import errors will result from attempting to use the Python
modules from the omniidl package other than via the scripts
provided by upstream in /usr/bin/
